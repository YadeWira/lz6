# lz6

**lz6** is an experimental lossless compressor: maximum compression with fast decompression.

It started as a fork of [LZ5 v1.5] (itself a LZ4 derivative) and grew into its own codec family:

- **Frame LZ/HC codec** — the classic LZ5-style byte-wise matcher, hardened and tuned.
- **seq engine** — an LZ match finder feeding an FSE/rANS entropy stage, with per-data-type transforms (byte-plane for interleaved floats, PRNG regeneration for pseudo-random data, order-0/order-1/huffman literal coding).
- **LZ6S2** — per-block codec dispatch: every block inside one frame picks its own engine (seq / light-LZ / raw escape).
- **LZ6S3** — content segmentation: the compressor tracks the byte-entropy profile while reading and cuts blocks at content shifts, so each region gets its own literal mode and transform.

## Usage

```
lz6 -2 file              # compress (seq engine, best ratio/speed trade)
lz6 -15 file             # maximum compression
lz6 --hc -9 file         # classic LZ6-HC frame codec
lz6 -d file.lz6          # decompress (codec-agnostic, per-block dispatch)
lz6 -2 -c file | lz6 -d -c     # pipes
lz6 -m file1 file2       # multiple inputs
```

Levels 1-15 select the seq engine; the default level uses the fast LZ frame codec. Blocks up to 256MB, match windows up to 32MB. Frames are self-describing and independently decodable per block.

## Build

Linux/macOS (gcc or clang, C99):

```
make -C programs lz6
```

Windows (mingw-w64 cross-compile from Linux, or MSVC):

```
./build_windows.sh      # win64 + win32, static, Win7 SP1+
```

## Benchmarks

Coming soon — the benchmark suite will be published once the testing hardware upgrade is complete. Measurement scripts and corpora tooling live in [bakeoff/](bakeoff/).

## Documentation

- [lz6_Block_format.md](lz6_Block_format.md) — raw block format
- [lz6_Frame_format.md](lz6_Frame_format.md) — frame format (block codec flags, per-block dispatch)
- [bakeoff/COMPETITORS.md](bakeoff/COMPETITORS.md) — competitive analysis vs zstd, lizard, misa77
- `lib/entropy/lz6seq.h` — the seq codec API

## Status

Experimental, format may change. The seq codec and the frame layer are fuzz-tested (corrupt raw streams + corrupted frames through the full `LZ6F_decompress` path); binaries are VM-tested on Windows 7 SP1 x64 and Windows 10.
